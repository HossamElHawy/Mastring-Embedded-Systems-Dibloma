## What Is Embedded Systems
Embedded software is computer software, written to control machines or devices that are not typically thought of as computers, commonly known as embedded systems. It is typically specialized for the particular hardware that it runs on and has time and memory constraints
## Why I Chose To Learn Embedded 
Embedded software engineers develop and implement the software of embedded devices and systems including smart watches, digital TVs, and electronic control units in a car. They may also be responsible for the analysis and monitoring of the efficiency and stability of a system. They develop and implement embedded devices and systems and support software quality assurance while optimizing I/O performance. They provide post-production support when necessary.
